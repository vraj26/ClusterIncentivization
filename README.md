# ClusterIncentivization
Implementing Cluster-Based Incentivization Utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms, Including K-Means Clustering


## Problem Statement
Lithion power is the largest producer of electric vehicle batteries.
They provide batteries on rent to e-vehicle drivers which can rent a singular battery typically for a dat and thereafter replacing it with a charged battery from the company.
Lithion power has a variable pricing model based on the driver's driving history.
Battery life dpends on factors such as speeding, distance driven per day, etc.
You are supposed to create a cluster model where drivers can be grouped together based on the driving data and group the datapoints so that druvers will be incentivized based on the cluster.

## Steps Covered
1. Importing Libraries and dataset
2. Fitting K-Means model on the dataset
3. Evaluating cluster centers and labels
4. Plotting the cluster to see distribution of datapoints
5. Iterating the same by changing the number of clusters to 4
6. Evaluating the clusters to see distribution of datapoints on new clusters
7. Plotting new clusters to see distriubtion
8. Drawing inference out of both of the plots
